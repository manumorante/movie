# Frontend pet-project

We'll be using The Movie Database to gather a list of movies to display in the home page. You can also add search and enter details by clicking in every movie card.

## Project requeriments

- Use a Clean Architecture Domain for every API request or action you need to perform in your application.
- Model your business logic accordingly using Entities or Value Objects.
- Make sure your input data is validated before it goes accross domain layers.
- Build necessary UI components.

## Project scaffolding

Clone this repo and use it to scaffold the project. Here you have Babel transpiling, webpack bundling and Mocha/Chai testing suite out of the box. ReactJs, React Router and Sass are also available to build UI components.
